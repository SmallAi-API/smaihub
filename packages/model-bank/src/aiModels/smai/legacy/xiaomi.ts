      "MiMo-V2.5-Pro is Xiaomi's most capable flagship model to date, delivering significant improvements in general agentic capabilities, complex software engineering, and long-horizon tasks. It retains the 1T total / 42B active hybrid-attention architecture with a 1M context window, and can sustain complex long-horizon tasks spanning more than a thousand tool calls. Performance on demanding agentic benchmarks (ClawEval, GDPVal, SWE-bench Pro) is comparable to Claude Opus 4.6.",

      'MiMo-V2.5 is a native omni-modal Agent foundation model that understands images, video, audio, and text in a unified architecture, with a 1M context window. It delivers Pro-level agentic performance at roughly half the inference cost of MiMo-V2.5-Pro, with improved multimodal perception over MiMo-V2-Omni. Its built-in agentic capabilities (browsing, understanding, reasoning, execution) and faster inference make it well-suited to latency-sensitive and multi-step agent frameworks such as OpenClaw.',
